phys system:

dont check collisions between static colliders

check collisions between dynamic bodies

contact points requrie: 
- collision normal
- mass of each object
- velocity at collision
	this requires calculating velocity at a point on a body from both linear and angular velocity 
		should be a simple distance function? something like linear velocity + dist * angular velocity
			what is the velocity of a point on a sphere with x linear velocity and r radius?

idea:
	create contacts that store these all and reference the phys bodies
	for each collision generate a contact, store them all in a vector, and then resolve each and delete

might also need to look into depenetration?

function pointer on colliders for oncollision that reference other collider

some objects are physical but others arent. should all objects have a body and the body class have a static flag?
